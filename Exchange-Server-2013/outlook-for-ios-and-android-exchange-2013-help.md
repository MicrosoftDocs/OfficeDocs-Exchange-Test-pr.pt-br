**Summary:** These articles contain architectural and security information for administrators about Outlook for iOS and Android in an Exchange 2013 on-premises environment.

Outlook for iOS and Android uses Basic authentication with Exchange ActiveSync in the following environments:

  - In Exchange Server 2010 environments

  - When a hybrid relationship with Office 365 has not been configured

  - When hybrid Modern Authentication has not been enabled
